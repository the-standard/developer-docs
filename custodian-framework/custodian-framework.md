# ðŸ—º Custodian Framework

### Introduction

The custodian framework is a combination of blockchain technology, DAO governance and real world auditing. Only the combination of all three makes the real asset custodianship possible.

### The Auditor

The designated Auditors job is to do a pre-audit of asset custodians, vaulting facilities, documents and more to ensure the principles of the protocol are followed. The Auditor gets highly rewarded for the job. To become an auditor you must be voted in by the DAO.&#x20;

The Auditor only gets paid for the job if the DAO deems his work to be good. There can never be only 1 auditor. As a minimum we propose the number of auditors to be 3 using a multi-sig process to enter the audit documents into the auditing chain.

As the auditor generally works as "filter" and will generate proposals, the DAO can review the work the auditor has been doing before approving the audit.&#x20;
