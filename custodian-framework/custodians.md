# ðŸ“¦ Custodians

**Independent Custodians**

Independent Custodians are tokenised asset providers who have issued their own asset backed tokens.\
\
It is the responsibility of The Standard DAO to set the security standards and audit the physical vaulting facilities of independent custodians. Once the DAOâ€™s security criteria have been met, the protocol will onboard independent custodian tokens that can be used as collateral in Smart Vaults.&#x20;

Asset backed tokens will be enabled using strategies that the DAO is voting on.

### **Native Custodians**

Native custodians are usually precious metals dealers or asset vaulting providers who are experts in securing and dealing with hard assets. Such custodians have legal contracts with The Standard DAO to ensure compliance with its custodian security framework. Users can access their vaulted assets balances via The Standard Protocol platform.&#x20;

## Auditing

Any custodian must be approved threw the auditing within the custodian framework.
