# Introduction



{% hint style="info" %}
**In Short:** The Standard Protocol is a decentralised finance (DeFi) infrastructure project that enables users to generate algorithmically stable cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. The protocol focuses on physically backed crypto-assets as collateral, low fees and flexibility. The project will be entirely managed by the community of **Standard Token **holders.
{% endhint %}

#### Purpose

With the Standard Protocol you can generate a "stable" cryptocurrencies backed by deposited assets in so called "Smart Vaults". Smart Vaults are the bread and butter of the protocol. They combine functionality and usability into a single user interface providing a way to hedge against inflation and volatility of the currency markets.

#### How is this achieved?

By generating a fiat currency, starting with "S-EUR", a soft pegged stable coin that is backed by inflation proof assets the user does not lose any purchase power if inflation would normally eat away at hard earned savings.
