# ðŸ’¶ Collateral Manager

## Introduction

A collateral manager handles the collateral pool of the protocol and the generation of StableCoin. For each type of collateral a unique manager is used. These smart contract act within collateral based on the rules that the Standard Dao has agreed to. Those rules are defined within the `Strategies`

The manager uses the stable coin generator to generate pre-approved stable coins.
