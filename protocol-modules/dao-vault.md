# DAO Vault

A DAO Vault is essentially Smart Vault with a set of strategies set out to allow users to stake their Standard Token (TST) to receive a reward for participating in the project.&#x20;

The functionality of the DAO Vault is more like a cryptocurrency wallet with a specific set of functions:

* `getBalance`

The treasury will interact with the registry of smart vaults to find all DAO vaults within the system and determine their balance and percentage of staked coins based on the total amount of TST issued at this point in time.

* `deposit`

Allows the user to deposit their TST from a linked cryptocurrency wallet

* `withdraw`

Allows the user to withdraw their TST from to linked cryptocurrency wallet
