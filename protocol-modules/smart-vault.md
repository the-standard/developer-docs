# üóù Smart Vault

### Introduction&#x20;

Smart vaults are combining different smart contract functionality to one cohesive user experience. Core functionality of the smart vault is interacting with the `collateral manager`. A `collateral manager` manages the collateral that is managing one collateral at a time. &#x20;

Vaults are agnostic to the type of `Strategies` their interact with. Think of it as your own personal vault providing you with functionality within the Standard Protocol system. One smart vault can have access to multiple strategies, leaving it open to the owner of the smart vault to interact with multiple collaterals within one platform.
