### **Paying the Stability Fee in Standard Token  **

By paying the stability fee in Standard Tokens, the fee is reduced by 50%. Standard Tokens that are used to pay the stability fee become part of the reserve. This reserve is called Treasury and is entirely managed by the DAO who decides what happens to the accumulated Standard Tokens.

Further, if the stability fee gets paid in Standard Tokens, 20% of the Standard Tokens goes towards the compensation of active voters, 30% goes towards the compensation of prediction market participants and the remaining 50% becomes part of the reserve.
